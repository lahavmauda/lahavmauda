# Lahav Mauda — Manual QA & Transition to Automation

## About Me
I am a detail-oriented **Manual QA Tester** with strong analytical skills, a collaborative team player,  
and a passion for delivering high-quality software.  
Currently expanding my skills in **Test Automation** (Python, Selenium, Playwright) to enhance my testing capabilities.

## Strengths in Manual QA
- Writing clear and comprehensive test cases.
- Designing test scenarios based on requirements and user stories.
- Detecting edge cases and identifying potential risks early.
- Executing functional, regression, and sanity tests with precision.
- Reporting defects effectively with detailed reproduction steps.
- **Team Collaboration** — work efficiently in diverse teams, fostering communication and shared goals.
- **Commitment to the Role** — dedicated to seeing tasks through to completion, ensuring quality and reliability.

## Career Transition
After 15+ years in industrial management — leading teams, optimizing processes, and ensuring operational quality —  
I decided to transition into the world of **Quality Assurance**. My background in **process improvement, problem-solving, and cross-team communication**  
gives me a strong foundation for identifying and addressing quality gaps in software products.
